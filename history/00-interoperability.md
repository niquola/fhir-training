* data formats
* communication protocols

### Types of Interoperability

* Syntactic Interoperability
* Semantic Interoperability


> Beyond the ability of two or more computer systems to exchange information,
> semantic interoperability is the ability to automatically interpret the information exchanged
> meaningfully and accurately in order to produce useful results as defined by the end users of both systems.
> To achieve semantic interoperability,
> both sides must refer to a common information exchange reference model.


For semantic interop:

* formats
* protocols
* reference model


### Open Standards

Open standards imply interoperability ab-initio.
Interoperability may be developed post-facto, when a vendor is forced to adapt its system to make it interoperable with a dominant system.
